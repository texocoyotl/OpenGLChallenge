# OpenGLChallenge

Small challenge presented as part of the Developer Meetup activities while working for Capital One. On these meetings, each developer presents a small problem that every other developer has to solve in less than 1 hour. After that, the solutions are discussed. Most of the developers just use a problem from HackerRank. I designed myself this one to demonstrate a few cool things you can do with OpenGL.
